Drug Generator (360/sec) produces SMILES
Smiles 2 Descriptors (2 drugs/second) produces Descriptors
One drug becomes 1000 inputs to response model (1000 cell lines)



Drug generator         Smiles to Descriptors          Response Prediction
360 drug smiles/sec    2 drug descriptors/sec         2000 inferences per drug

You can generate 360 drugs per second. To match this output, we need to translate 360 drug smiles to descriptors per second
